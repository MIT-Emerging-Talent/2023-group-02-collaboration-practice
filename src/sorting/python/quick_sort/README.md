## Challenge: Quick Sort Function
QuickSort follow divide-and-conquer paradigm. The basic idea behind QuickSort is to select a "pivot" element from the array and partition the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The process is then applied recursively to the sub-arrays.

## How it Works:
1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
Partitioning:
2. Reorder the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it, and elements greater than the pivot come after it.
3. At the end of this step, the pivot is in its final sorted position.
4. Apply the same process recursively to the sub-arrays on the left and right of the pivot.
